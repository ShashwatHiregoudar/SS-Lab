What language you should know to develop boot loader
to develop the simple boot loader you need to know C or C++
(((mixed code - combine higher level and lower level instructions)))


What compiler you need

To use mixed code technology 
you need at least two compilers: 
for Assembler and C/C++, and also 
the linker 
to join object files (.obj) into the one executable

There are two modes of processor functioning: 
real mode -  Real mode is 16-bit and has some limitations.
protected mode - Protected mode is 32-bit and is fully used in OS work

to build the program and obtain executable file,
you will need the compiler and linker of Assembler for 16-bit mode
